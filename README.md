# A solution to task Scheduling Problem Using Genetic Algorithm in Parallel System
An implementation of Task Scheduling Strategy which use task duplication and genetic algorithm to reduce communication  overhead between processors and waiting time which occurs during resolving dependencies between multiple tasks. Technologies Used: OpenMP, C++.

This folder Contains two Project GeneticAlgo which uses openMP and the sequential version of the project SeqGeneticAlgo.
please use eclipse to open and run these projects.

Alternatively Projects can be compiled from Debug directory using

// to build
` make`

and 

// to clean
`make clean`  


commands.

And to run Genetic Algo please use syntax

        ./GeneticAlgo [No of Processes to create] [No of tasks to create] [OpenMP Threads] [No of best processors to select]



And to run Sequential Genetic Algo please use syntax

        ./SeqGeneticAlgo [No of Processes to create] [No of tasks to create] [No of best processors to select]


Thanks !!!!!
